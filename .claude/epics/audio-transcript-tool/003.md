# Task 003: Audio Processing Integration

## Description

Implement comprehensive audio processing capabilities using the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder API. This task focuses on the core audio functionality including recording, waveform visualization, format conversion, and real-time audio analysis.

The implementation should provide a robust foundation for audio capture and processing that integrates seamlessly with the UI components and prepares audio data for transcription services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MediaRecorder integration for audio capture
- [ ] Real-time waveform visualization during recording
- [ ] Audio format validation and conversion
- [ ] Audio level monitoring and normalization
- [ ] Playback controls with scrubbing capability
- [ ] Audio file upload and processing
- [ ] Noise reduction and audio enhancement
- [ ] Audio chunking for large files
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Error handling for device permission issues
- [ ] Performance optimization for large audio files

## Technical Details

### Audio Recording Architecture
```typescript
interface AudioRecorder {
  startRecording(): Promise<void>;
  stopRecording(): Promise<Blob>;
  pauseRecording(): void;
  resumeRecording(): void;
  getRecordingLevel(): number;
  getWaveformData(): Float32Array;
}

interface AudioProcessor {
  loadAudioFile(file: File): Promise<AudioBuffer>;
  generateWaveform(buffer: AudioBuffer): Float32Array;
  normalizeAudio(buffer: AudioBuffer): AudioBuffer;
  applyNoiseReduction(buffer: AudioBuffer): AudioBuffer;
  convertFormat(buffer: AudioBuffer, format: string): Blob;
}
```

### Core Features

#### MediaRecorder Integration
- Browser permission handling
- Multiple audio format support (webm, mp4, wav)
- Configurable quality settings
- Real-time data streaming

#### Waveform Visualization
- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Real-time updates during recording
- Zoom and scroll functionality
- Timeline markers and annotations

#### Audio Processing Pipeline
```typescript
AudioInput → FormatValidation → BufferCreation → 
WaveformGeneration → NoiseReduction → Normalization → 
ChunkProcessing → TranscriptionPrep
```

#### File Upload Processing
- Drag-and-drop file handling
- Progress tracking for large files
- Format conversion as needed
- Metadata extraction (duration, sample rate, etc.)

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 66+ (MediaRecorder stable)
- Firefox 70+ (AudioWorklet support)
- Safari 14+ (getUserMedia improvements)
- Fallback strategies for older browsers

### Performance Considerations
- Web Workers for heavy processing
- AudioWorklet for real-time processing
- Efficient memory management for large files
- Progressive loading for better UX

## Dependencies

- **Blocks on:** Task 001 (Foundation Setup)
- **Parallel with:** Task 002 (UI Component Development)
- **Integrates with:** Future transcription service integration

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium)**
- Estimated Duration: 2-3 days
- Complexity: Medium-High (Web Audio API complexity, browser compatibility)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Audio recording works across all supported browsers
- [ ] Waveform visualization renders smoothly in real-time
- [ ] Audio file upload handles files up to 100MB
- [ ] Format conversion produces valid output files
- [ ] Noise reduction improves audio quality measurably
- [ ] Performance tests show <100ms latency for real-time features
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages device/permission issues
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable with large audio files
- [ ] Integration tests with UI components pass
- [ ] Audio processing pipeline documented with examples
- [ ] Code coverage reaches 85%+ for audio processing modules
