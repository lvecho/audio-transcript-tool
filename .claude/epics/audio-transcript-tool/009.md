# Task 009: Performance Optimization

## Description

Comprehensive performance optimization of the entire audio transcript tool including bundle optimization, lazy loading, memory management, and overall performance tuning. This task focuses on making the application fast, efficient, and scalable for production use.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bundle Optimization
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Split code into logical chunks for optimal loading
- [ ] **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code and dependencies
- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Analyze and optimize bundle sizes
- [ ] **Asset Optimization**: Compress images, fonts, and static assets
- [ ] **Dynamic Imports**: Load components and modules on demand

### Lazy Loading
- [ ] **Component Lazy Loading**: Load UI components when needed
- [ ] **Route-Based Splitting**: Split by application routes/features
- [ ] **Model Lazy Loading**: Load AI models only when required
- [ ] **Session Lazy Loading**: Load history sessions incrementally
- [ ] **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality loads first

### Memory Management
- [ ] **Memory Leak Prevention**: Identify and fix memory leaks
- [ ] **Audio Buffer Management**: Optimize audio data handling
- [ ] **Session Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of completed sessions
- [ ] **Cache Management**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
- [ ] **Worker Thread Optimization**: Optimize Web Worker usage

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals**: Optimize LCP, FID, CLS metrics
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Track load times, interaction delays
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Monitor and log performance issues
- [ ] **User Experience Metrics**: Track real user performance
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: Establish and enforce performance budgets

### Caching Strategies
- [ ] **Service Worker**: Implement caching for offline support
- [ ] **Browser Caching**: Optimize HTTP caching headers
- [ ] **Model Caching**: Cache loaded AI models
- [ ] **Session Caching**: Cache frequently accessed sessions
- [ ] **API Response Caching**: Cache API responses intelligently

## Technical Details

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  loadTime: number;
  transcriptionTime: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  bundleSize: number;
  interactionDelay: number;
}

class PerformanceMonitor {
  trackMetric(name: string, value: number): void;
  trackUserTiming(name: string, startTime: number, endTime: number): void;
  trackMemoryUsage(): MemoryInfo;
  reportCoreWebVitals(): WebVitalsReport;
  logPerformanceIssue(issue: PerformanceIssue): void;
}
```

### Code Splitting Strategy
- Split by feature: audio processing, transcription, history, export
- Split by route: main app, settings, history panel
- Split vendor libraries separately
- Implement preloading for critical chunks

### Memory Optimization
```typescript
class MemoryManager {
  cleanupAudioBuffers(): void;
  releaseModelMemory(): void;
  clearSessionCache(): void;
  monitorMemoryUsage(): void;
  enforceMemoryLimits(): void;
}

// Weak references for large objects
class AudioCache {
  private cache = new WeakMap();
  private refs = new Map();
  
  store(key: string, audio: AudioBuffer): void;
  retrieve(key: string): AudioBuffer | null;
  cleanup(): void;
}
```

### Bundle Analysis Tools
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer for size analysis
- Source map explorer for dead code detection
- Performance budgets in build process
- Automated performance regression testing

### Caching Implementation
```typescript
interface CacheStrategy {
  key: string;
  ttl: number;
  maxSize: number;
  evictionPolicy: 'lru' | 'fifo' | 'ttl';
}

class CacheManager {
  private modelCache: Map<string, any>;
  private sessionCache: Map<string, SessionData>;
  private responseCache: Map<string, any>;
  
  async get<T>(key: string, strategy: CacheStrategy): Promise<T | null>;
  async set<T>(key: string, value: T, strategy: CacheStrategy): Promise<void>;
  evict(pattern: string): void;
  clear(): void;
  getStats(): CacheStats;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualization for large lists (history, search results)
- Debouncing for search and input handlers
- Request deduplication for API calls
- Image lazy loading and responsive images
- Font loading optimization

## Dependencies

**Requires completion of:**
- Task 001: Core Architecture (foundation to optimize)
- Task 002: UI Components (components to optimize)
- Task 003: Audio Processing (audio handling to optimize)
- Task 004: Transcription Engine (transcription to optimize)
- Task 005: Data Management (storage to optimize)
- Task 006: Summary Generation (AI processing to optimize)
- Task 007: Export System (export functionality to optimize)

**Note:** This task must be executed after all core functionality is implemented, as it optimizes existing features rather than building new ones.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (2-3 days)**
