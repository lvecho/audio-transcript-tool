# Task 001: Foundation Setup

## Description

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the audio-transcript-tool project by setting up a modern React development environment with Vite, TypeScript, and all necessary build tools and configurations.

This task creates the core project structure, development toolchain, and CI/CD pipeline that all subsequent tasks will depend upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React 18+ application scaffolded with Vite
- [ ] TypeScript configuration with strict settings
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
- [ ] Basic folder structure established following React best practices
- [ ] Package.json with all core dependencies defined
- [ ] Vite development server runs without errors
- [ ] Production build pipeline functional
- [ ] Basic CI/CD workflow configured
- [ ] Environment configuration setup (dev/prod)
- [ ] Basic error boundary and routing structure

## Technical Details

### Package Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.8.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^3.1.0",
    "vite": "^4.1.0",
    "typescript": "^4.9.0",
    "eslint": "^8.35.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^5.54.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^5.54.0",
    "prettier": "^2.8.0"
  }
}
```

### Folder Structure
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── pages/              # Page-level components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── styles/             # Global styles and theme
└── assets/             # Static assets
```

### Configuration Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Build tool configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler options
- `.eslintrc.js` - Linting rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundational task that other tasks depend on.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium)**
- Estimated Duration: 2-3 days
- Complexity: Medium (standard setup with modern tooling)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Development server starts with `npm run dev`
- [ ] All linting and formatting checks pass
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] Basic CI pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Project structure documented in README
- [ ] All team members can clone and run the project locally
- [ ] Production deployment pipeline verified
