# Task 002: UI Component Development

## Description

Convert the existing voice_recognition_1.html design into a modern, interactive React component library. This task focuses on building the core UI components that will provide the user interface for audio upload, recording, transcription display, and notes management.

The components should be responsive, accessible, and follow React best practices with proper state management and component composition.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Header component with navigation and settings
- [ ] AudioUploadZone component with drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] AudioRecorder component with visual feedback
- [ ] TranscriptionView component with formatted text display
- [ ] HistoryPanel component for managing past transcriptions
- [ ] NotesEditor component with rich text editing capabilities
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Components follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- [ ] PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces defined for all components
- [ ] Storybook documentation for each component
- [ ] Unit tests for component behavior

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Component hierarchy
App
├── Header
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── SettingsPanel
├── MainContent
│   ├── AudioUploadZone
│   ├── AudioRecorder
│   └── TranscriptionView
└── Sidebar
    ├── HistoryPanel
    └── NotesEditor
```

### Key Components

#### AudioUploadZone
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- File format validation (mp3, wav, m4a, etc.)
- Visual upload progress indicator
- File size and duration display

#### AudioRecorder
- Start/stop/pause recording controls
- Real-time waveform visualization
- Recording timer display
- Audio level meter

#### TranscriptionView
- Formatted text display with timestamps
- Search and highlight functionality
- Export options (text, SRT, VTT)
- Speaker identification markers

#### HistoryPanel
- List of previous transcriptions
- Search and filter capabilities
- Quick preview on hover
- Delete and organize options

#### NotesEditor
- Rich text editing (bold, italic, lists)
- Auto-save functionality
- Word count and character count
- Export to various formats

### Styling Approach
- CSS Modules or Styled Components
- Design system with consistent tokens
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive breakpoints

## Dependencies

- **Blocks on:** Task 001 (Foundation Setup)
- **Parallel with:** Task 003 (Audio Processing Integration)

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium)**
- Estimated Duration: 2-3 days
- Complexity: Medium (component conversion with state management)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Components are responsive across device sizes
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes with no critical issues
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all props
- [ ] Storybook stories created and functional
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass
- [ ] Design matches original HTML mockup
- [ ] Components integrate cleanly with React Router
- [ ] Performance audit shows no significant issues
