# PRD: Audio Transcript Tool

## Executive Summary

The Audio Transcript Tool is a web-based application designed to provide meeting recorders with efficient, accurate, and intelligent audio transcription capabilities. Built with modern web technologies, it leverages Alibaba's Qwen3-ASR for high-precision Chinese voice recognition and Qwen3-Next-80B for intelligent content summarization. The tool supports both real-time recording and file upload workflows, enabling users to convert audio content into actionable text documents with one-click summarization.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Real-time transcription with live audio visualization
- High-accuracy Chinese speech recognition (Qwen3-ASR)
- One-click intelligent summarization of meeting content
- Local-first approach ensuring data privacy and security
- Multiple export formats for various downstream applications

## Problem Statement

**Primary Problem:** Meeting recorders currently face significant challenges in converting audio content into actionable, structured text documents efficiently.

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Manual Transcription Overhead:** Converting 2-hour meetings into text manually takes 6-8 hours
2. **Poor Accuracy with Generic Tools:** Existing tools struggle with Chinese language nuances and domain-specific terminology
3. **Fragmented Workflow:** Users need separate tools for recording, transcription, editing, and summarization
4. **Privacy Concerns:** Cloud-based solutions expose sensitive meeting content to third parties
5. **Limited Export Options:** Most tools don't provide structured output formats needed for different use cases

**Why This Matters Now:**
- Remote work has increased reliance on recorded meetings
- Legal and compliance requirements demand accurate meeting documentation
- AI advancements now enable near real-time processing with high accuracy
- Growing demand for privacy-preserving solutions
